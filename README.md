# Supermarket Billing System in C++

This project is a basic supermarket billing system implemented in C++. It allows users to calculate bills for multiple items and manage the inventory of a supermarket. The program provides a simple console-based interface for adding new items to the inventory, printing bills for purchased items, and updating the inventory accordingly.

## Features

- **Add New Items**: Add new items to the supermarket's inventory with specified rates and quantities.
- **Purchase Items**: Calculate the bill for multiple items bought by a customer, considering the available stock and item rates.
- **Inventory Management**: Maintain and update the inventory after each purchase to ensure correct stock levels.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs or if an item is not found in the inventory.
- **Total Bill Calculation**: Calculates the total cost for all items in a single purchase operation.

## How It Works

1. The program reads the initial inventory from a file named `supermarket_inventory.txt`.
2. Users can add new items to the inventory with specified names, rates, and quantities.
3. When printing a bill, users can enter multiple items with their desired quantities. The program checks if the requested quantity is available and calculates the total cost.
4. After a purchase, the inventory is updated, and the changes are saved to the file.
5. The program provides an exit option to end the session, saving any changes made to the inventory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++).
3. Run the compiled executable to interact with the billing system.
4. Use the console-based interface to add items, print bills, and manage inventory.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and console-based interfaces
