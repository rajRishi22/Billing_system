# Billing_system
This project is a basic supermarket billing system implemented in C++. It allows users to calculate bills for multiple items and manage the inventory of a supermarket. The program provides a simple console-based interface for adding new items to the inventory, printing bills for purchased items, and updating the inventory accordingly.
